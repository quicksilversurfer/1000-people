      <h1>1000 People</h1>
      <h2>A network graph of people in a community of practice, visualizing the connections between them.</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        To understand a community, knowing more about the notable people in that community is a great place to start. 1000 people is a small data visualization project where I wanted to visualize Wikipedia entries of people in a particular field.
      </p>
      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p>
        Data was collected from dbPedia and converted into a nodes links database. Each node represents a person, and the links are structured data entries about them. CSV data conversion to JSON node-link database was done through a Python script (thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anulksinha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anul Kumar Sinha</a>!) which was then visualized by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prateek-solanki-78313218/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prateek Solanki</a> in d3.js

        As the name suggests it's a work in progress.
